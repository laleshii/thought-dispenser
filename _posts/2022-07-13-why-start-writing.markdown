The gist of it is I’m trying to **put my thoughts in order** and I think writing is a good method of doing that.

There is no other hidden goal behind it however I do find it interesting to observe why does writing work for me and why I think this way of writing might get the best thoughts out in the open.

## Forcing function

As any social creature with a healthy dose of selfishness there’s a certain degree of behavior constraint happening whenever you say something out loud and others can hear it. That fear of being perceived in a bad manner can probably be seen as a curse but I want to use it to my advantage.

In this case, having a public blog would force me to “clean up” my thoughts enough to lay them in writing. That would imply spending a lot more time on a subject, dissecting it and attempting to judge it from multiple perspectives. I will try my best not to casually give opinions on matters that I just learned about.

**TL;DR** I’m trying to use the added social pressure of having my words publicly available to push myself into more confidently standing behind my words.

## Topics

The posts are going to be on subjects that are of interest to me at that time. As of right now you might expect a mix of technical, lifestyle, philosophical and psychological issues discussed. Political issues might slip from time to time as it’s hard to escape them.

The future however might come with other domains that I cannot think of right now so some sort of organization scheme might be applied to make some clarity in how to access specific content.

## Ground rules

Additional rules might be added in the future if the need arises but this is the minimum that I want to impose from the start. If for any reason I will change these first 3 rules I probably failed to keep this a personal project.

### No visitor trackers

I don’t want this to get in a space where I am trying to capture the attention of other people for that sweet sweet dopamine shot. With that in mind, there will be no activity tracking on this website of any kind.

### No comments section

This is not meant to be a platform of discussion but rather a safe place for me to lay out my thoughts. An email address is provided if you want to reach out to me directly however any other comments can be made in one’s personal circles.

### No fixed post schedule

I will release new content whenever I feel like writing. This means the frequency might be off sometimes.
