Living a meaningful life could mean a lot of things for a lot of people. For me personally, at the time of writing these words, it revolves around the idea of **experiencing the world and expanding your thought horizon**.

The idea of having experiences should be relatively straightforward. When you stop experiencing (sensing) the world you most probably are dead mentally if not also physically.

Besides being a fancy way of saying learning, expanding your thought horizon in my mind involves a bit more than acquiring new skills and concepts. It involves empathy, looking at things from multiple perspectives and a thirst for novel ideas.

## Comfort

Regardless of what you think is a meaningful life, I believe we can come to an agreement that comfort has more or less the same definition for most people. Comfort is the environment that does not create physical or mental distress.

Just to clarify, I am not against comfort and living comfortably. I am grateful every day to the inventors of the dishwasher[^1] and the washing machine[^2] that give me the leisure time to lay my thoughts on this page, however ...

It is quite common for people living in western societies to have a tendency to make comfort their ultimate life goal.

My argument against comfort though: it is inversely proportional with the idea of living a meaningful life. The more comfortable you are, the less you are living. Some even suggest that being comfortable all the time does not necessarily help with your lifespan[^3] but I will leave that discussion for some other time. Don't close the page just yet, let me explain.

## Well-being overdose

Seeking comfort is only natural. I don't want to always look for a place to sleep overnight. I don't want to have to hunt for my food. I don't want to have to walk for 25 minutes to work. I don't want to ...

Where does it stop though? How do you trace which are actual needs that will benefit you and which are things that will drag you down.

Being very comfortable adds constraints in your day to day routine and disconnects you from the world. The more disconnected we are with the world and its hardships the more constrained you are to believe that only your immediate reality is the truth.

What constraints you ask? I can only sleep in my apartment in location X. I will only eat things bought within a 10km radius around me. I can only go to work by car. I can only ...

I think there's a great deal of people living comfort abundant lives that think their comfort-imposed constraints are immutable. A huge number of such limitations results in a miserable existence but I do find it quite difficult to spot the fine line between living in comfort and living meaningfully.

## The subtle balance

As with anything in our lives, finding a balance is something that only the individual can figure out. It is a personal affair with too many variables to have a universal solution for.

That being said, I do find that the start towards a better understanding of the issue is rooted in the idea of self-reflecting. And even though a lot of people don't seem to practice it[^4], just asking at the end of the day "why am I doing this?" could go a long way.

I like to look at comfort as the liberation from menial daily issues that you've outgrown. Issues that you've already mastered and can always tackle but choose not to in the pursuit of greater things that bring you joy.

There is definitely depth and contentment in repetitive chores. For me, preparing a meal in the course of my day is always enjoyable but others might find that unbearable.

Even though we can't (and probably don't want to) experience everything in this world the least we can do is put some thought into the reasoning behind our decision.

So my question to you dear reader is: what is your comfort helping you pursue?
