<p>There is no other hidden goal behind it however I do find it interesting to observe why does writing work for me and why I think this way of writing might get the best thoughts out in the open.</p>

<h2 id="forcing-function">Forcing function</h2>

<p>As any social creature with a healthy dose of selfishness there’s a certain degree of behavior constraint happening whenever you say something out loud and others can hear it. That fear of being perceived in a bad manner can probably be seen as a curse but I want to use it to my advantage.</p>

<p>In this case, having a public blog would force me to “clean up” my thoughts enough to lay them in writing. That would imply spending a lot more time on a subject, dissecting it and attempting to judge it from multiple perspectives. I will try my best not to casually give opinions on matters that I just learned about.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I’m trying to use the added social pressure of having my words publicly available to push myself into more confidently standing behind my words.</p>

<h2 id="ground-rules">Ground rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>No visitor trackers</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t want this to get in a space where I am trying to capture the attention of other people for that sweet sweet dopamine shot. With that in mind, there will be no activity tracking on this website of any kind.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>No comments section</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This is not meant to be a platform of discussion but rather a safe place for me to lay out my thoughts. An email address is provided if you want to reach out to me directly however any other comments can be made in one’s personal circles.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="rules" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gist of it is I’m trying to put my thoughts in order and I think writing is a good method of doing that.]]></summary></entry></feed>
